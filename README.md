# MIS515-Projects

These are the 3 projects that I worked on during MIS 515 Object Oriented Programming Spring 2024 at SDSU. We explored and learn how to code data analysis and processing to include visualization, regression and classification. Using different algorithms to train and test datasets. The codes also include application of data cleaning and filtering to produce the most accurate results possible.
